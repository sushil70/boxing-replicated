                      Boxing (pugilism) is a combative sport in which two
                      combatants, generally of similar weight fight each other
                      with their fists. Boxing is supervised by a referee and is
                      typically engaged in during a series of three-minute
                      intervals called rounds with a one minute rest period
                      (recovery) in between each round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There are various ways victory is achieved in a boxing
                      match: When an opponent is knocked down and unable to rise
                      to his feet before the referee counts to ten seconds or is
                      unconscious (a Knockout or KO) or if the opponent is
                      deemed too injured to continue (a Technical Knockout, or
                      TKO). Because boxing is subjective in nature and is scored
                      on a point system, then if a bout goes the entire
                      distance, a winner is then determined by 3 independent
                      judges' scorecards. Presently in the United States, there
                      is no federal commission to regulate or oversee
                      professional prize fighting, this has caused a lack of
                      uniformity that currently exists among all boxing
                      commissions regarding the rules, regulations and medical
                      requirements. Generally bouts take place in a "ring" that
                      is 18 to 24 square feet in length and is enclosed on each
                      side by four strands of rope.

                    <p>
                      The ancient Greeks provide us our first historical records
                      of boxing as a sport; they codified a set of rules and
                      staged tournaments with professionals. Boxing became an
                      official sport of the Olympic game as early as 688 B.C.,
                      23rd Olympiad. The modern era of boxing evolved in Great
                      Britain, in 1866 the 9th Marques of Queensberry gave his
                      support to a new set of rules, which were named in his
                      honor. The Marques of Queensberry rule is a code of
                      generally accepted rules in the sport of boxing. They are
                      intended for use in both professional and amateur boxing
                      matches. These rules limit the number of 3- minute rounds,
                      eliminated wrestling tactics, and made the use of boxing
                      gloves mandatory.

                      Because of the intense activity of boxing, it is very
                      important for the fighters to be highly conditioned, both
                      physically and mentally. A fighter entering the ring in
                      anything but a high level of physical conditioning can
                      expect, at the very least, to be knocked unconscious and
                      increases the risk of serious injury, or death if ill
                      prepared.

                      Listed are the various boxing rules: Boxers are prohibited
                      from hitting below the belt (groin area), holding,
                      tripping, pushing, biting, spitting, or wrestling. They
                      are not allowed to kick, head-butt, or hitting with any
                      part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist
                      (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as
                      well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or
                      side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from
                      hitting the back, back of the neck or head (rabbit-punch)
                      or the kidneys and are prevented from holding the ropes
                      for support when punching, and holding an opponent while
                      punching. A "clinch" -- a defensive tactic in which a
                      boxer wraps his/her opponents arms with the sole intention
                      being to prevent from being hit - once the referee
                      separates the fighters, each fighter must take a full step
                      back before fighting is resumed ( referee has the power to
                      direct the fighters to "punch out" of the clinch). When a
                      boxer is knocked down by a punch, his/her opponent must
                      immediately cease fighting and go to the nearest neutral
                      corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a
                      knockout or requested for the fight to continue.

                      Proper structure to the training session is an important
                      pre-requisite to obtaining desirable results. When
                      designing a workout, it is necessary to identify which
                      energy systems are used in the activity. Based on the
                      systems used, training time can be devoted to improvement
                      of that system. It is also important to identify the
                      initial fitness level of the participant, the intensity of
                      the activity, frequency, duration, and the method of
                      training to be used.

                      Based on duration and intensity of the activity, four
                      predominant energy pathways have been identified in boxing
                      and any sport. The systems identified are the ATP, ATP-CP,
                      Lactic Acid and the Aerobic-oxidative system. A basic

                      ATP (adenosine tri phosphate) is the immediate source of
                      energy for muscular contraction. There are two pathways
                      through which it is formed: the aerobic pathway and the
                      anaerobic pathway. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen to
                      be present and utilizes fat, protein and carbohydrates
                      (glucose, glycogen) to resynthesize ATP. When movement is
                      very quick and explosive, there is not enough time for
                      oxygen to be delivered to the contracting muscles. This is
                      where the anaerobic pathway is called into action. The
                      anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen and uses only
                      carbohydrates to produce ATP. There is enough ATP stored
                      in muscle to last for only three seconds of contraction.

                      When ATP is broken down and the energy is released, ADP
                      (adenosine diphosphate) and P (phosphate) are formed.
                      Another important source of energy is CP (creatine
                      phosphate). CP cannot be used directly by the muscle, so
                      it interacts with ADP and CP to re-form ATP. There is not
                      a lot of CP available to the muscle so it too must be
                      continually resynthesized. The ATP-CP system can supply
                      enough energy to last for eight seconds of intense
                      exercise.

                      When intense activity is continued for about ninety
                      seconds, glycogen is used as an energy source. When the
                      glycogen is broken down, more ATP is produced. However, if
                      the activity is intense (anaerobic),there will not be
                      enough oxygen supplied to the muscles. When glycogen is
                      burned in the absence of oxygen, lactic acid is produced.
                      Once lactic acid is formed, it diffuses into the blood and
                      is transported to different areas of the body. This allows
                      the working muscle to continue. Eventually, the lactic
                      acid level will accumulate to a level that will slow down
                      the biochemical reactions that lead to the production of
                      ATP. Accumulation of lactic acid causes pain and burning
                      sensations in the stressed muscles. Shortly thereafter,
                      contraction will not be able to take place.

                      If this intense activity is to continue, the body will
                      shift into the aerobic-oxidative system. The body will
                      need an increased oxygen supply. This extra oxygen will be
                      available only if the intensity of the activity is
                      decreased. This higher oxygen consumption converts the
                      lactic acid to pyruvate, which converts to carbon dioxide
                      and water and is dispelled from the lungs. Pyruvate is a
                      product of burned glycogen. If pyruvate is formed in the
                      absence of oxygen, lactic acid formation will be the
                      result. The system will then shift back into the anaerobic
                      systems.

                      During the recovery period of training, the ATP-CP must be
                      built-up and replenished and the accumulated lactic acid
                      must be removed. If these needs aren't met, the systems
                      will be un-available for further activity. While resting
                      after an anaerobic work bout, oxygen consumption is
                      increased because of the increased depth and rate of
                      breathing. This extra oxygen turns the lactic acid back to
                      pyruvic acid and within 20 seconds, 50% of the ATP and CP
                      is restored, in 40 seconds, 75% is restored and in 60
                      seconds, 87% is restored. Almost all of the ATP and CP are
                      replenished within three minutes. The removal rate of
                      lactic acid is slower then the rebuilding rate of ATP and
                      CP. In 25 minutes, 50% of the lactic acid will be removed,
                      in 50 minutes, 75% and 87% in 75 minutes. The removal rate
                      of lactic acid can be sped up through light activity
                      performed during the recovery period. This is because some
                      of the lactic acid is metabolized aerobically during the
                      light activity.

                      The rest interval is very important. The work rest ratio
                      in Appendix A has been designed according to physiological
                      guidelines. If the rest period is too brief, the ATP and
                      CP will not be sufficiently replenished and the
                      accumulated lactic acid will not be adequately removed.
                      The next bout of exercise would have to be performed at a
                      lower intensity. If the rest period is too long, the body
                      will recover and the training effect will be lost.

                      To obtain desired results, it is important to train at the
                      proper intensity (degree of overload). The intensity of an
                      activity is dependent upon many factors, mainly the goals
                      of the participant. If the goal is health-related fitness,
                      the intensity does not need to be as high as an athletes
                      intensity who set a goal of increased performance. Both
                      individuals need to monitor their workload through heart
                      rate (HR) to determine and work at the optimal intensity.

                      The first step is to determine the resting heart rate
                      (RHR). The best results are obtained early in the morning
                      immediately upon awakening. A reliable RHR is obtained by
                      averaging the results of three mornings in a row. The HR
                      may be taken by placing fingers on the carotid artery on
                      the side of the neck, the temporal artery in front of the
                      ear (temple) or at the radial artery at the base of the
                      thumb. A good estimation of the HR is to count the pulse
                      for 10 or 15 seconds and multiply by 6 or 4, respectively.
                      This will give the HR in beats per minute (bpm). If the
                      pulse was counted 18 times in 15 seconds, the RHR is 72
                      bpm (18x4=72 bpm).

                      The maximum heart rate (MHR) is needed to calculate the HR
                      at which the workload should be performed. The direct
                      method of determining MHR is to monitor the HR of a
                      subject running to exhaustion on a treadmill. An easier
                      way is to subtract age from 220. A 20 year old athlete
                      will have a MHR of 200 bpm (220- 20=200).

                      The training heart rate (THR) is the HR at which the
                      workload should be performed to obtain a desired
                      physiological response. The desired percentage of MHR is
                      multiplied by MHR to determine the THR. If the same 20
                      year old athlete is to perform a workout that calls for an

                      For a training effect to occur, the appropriate overload
                      must be placed on the targeted system. The aerobic system
                      needs to be trained at 60-90% of MHR for a training effect
                      to occur. Healthy, sedentary individuals should start at
                      the lower end (60%) and gradually build up over time.
                      Trained aerobic athletes should train near the upper end
                      (90%). The anaerobic systems need to be trained at 90-100%
                      of MHR. How often should the systems be overloaded?
                      Research shows that 3 days per week is the minimum for
                      aerobic training. Moderately trained individuals should
                      train 3-5 days per week while highly trained athletes can
                      train 5-7 days per week. The anaerobic systems need a
                      minimum of 3 days per week and can be trained on the same
                      days as the aerobic system. It is recommended that the
                      anaerobic work precedes the aerobic training. Other days
                      can be spent developing skill and techniques.

                      Thai-pads and a stop watch (Modern sport watches with a
                      repeat timer work very well). Warming-up is important to
                      physically and psychologically prepare the participant for
                      the increased demands about to be placed on the body.
                      There are two types of warm-up: General and Specific.
                      General warm-up consists of calisthenics, stretching and
                      non-sport specific activity. Specific warm-up is
                      performing the actual activity itself in a light, easy
                      manner. The warm-up listed in Appendix B is a Specific
                      warm-up. It begins with a 4 minute round of round kicks on
                      the Thai-pads. The 4 minute rest interval should be spent
                      stretching or holding the pads for the previous holder.
                      Workouts are ideally started and finished by one
                      individual before holding for the partner. At completion
                      of the 4 minute rest period, a 2 minute round of Form is
                      done. Kicks, knees and elbows are thrown light and easy.
                      The emphasis is on proper form. The two minute rest
                      prepares the body for Accelerations. Accelerations help
                      prepare the body for high intensity work. Each round lasts
                      16 seconds. The first 8 seconds is done at an easy pace
                      and the last 8 seconds is done at full speed. Two
                      consecutive kicks are thrown with the same leg before
                      switching. The rest period is 24 seconds between each of
                      the 4 rounds. A one minute rest is given prior to the
                      Gutbuster rounds. Gutbusters consist of 4 rounds lasting
                      10 seconds each. one kick per side is thrown at full
                      intensity (no holding back). Gutbusters train the ATP-CP
                      system. There is a 3 minute rest at completion of the
                      Gutbuster rounds. Next is the workout!

                      In one, three minute Thai-boxing round, a fighter will
                      receive approximately 30% of his energy from the ATP-CP

                      The results are termed the training-sensitive zone. This

                      rest ratio, % max HR, etc.) many other training methods
                      can be devised. Other methods of training can be used with
                      the chart as well. Some other methods of training that are
                      also important to boxing include running (especially

                      Strength and muscle endurance are important components in
                      boxing. Strength is the amount of force that can be
                      exerted by a muscle group for one movement. Muscle
                      endurance is the ability of a muscle to contract over a
                      period of time. The advantages of these two traits is
                      obvious when applied to boxing. Many trainers of Western
                      boxing feel that weight training will make the athlete
                      muscle bound and slow them down. All research conclusively
                      demonstrates that a properly designed and implemented
                      boxing specific program will increase speed and power.
                      Take a look at the World Record holder in the 100 meters.
                      Leroy Burrell is obviously a fan of weight training. Is
                      Manny Pacquiao slow?

                      Weight training can increase both muscular endurance and
                      strength. There are four basic principles to follow while
                      on a weight- resistance training program:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="pl-1">
                      <li>
                        <i
                          className="fa fa-check-square-o"
                          aria-hidden="true"
                        />
                        &nbsp;Overload-forcing the muscles to contract at near
                        maximum levels. Through overload, the muscle will be
                        forced to adapt.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <i
                          className="fa fa-check-square-o"
                          aria-hidden="true"
                        />
                        &nbsp;Progressive resistance-the training load must be
                        progressively increased to cause overload to the muscle.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <i
                          className="fa fa-check-square-o"
                          aria-hidden="true"
                        />
                        &nbsp;Specificity-the muscle adaptations are specific to
                        the type of training done. Therefore, the same muscles
                        used in Thai-boxing need to be stressed while weight
                        training.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <i
                          className="fa fa-check-square-o"
                          aria-hidden="true"
                        />
                        &nbsp;Recovery-a muscle fatigued from the effects of
                        weight training needs 48 hours recovery before
                        resistance training is repeated.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      To determine the proper amount of resistance to train
                      with, a 1 repetition max (RM) is used. One RM is the
                      maximum load that can be moved through the full range of
                      motion for 1 repetition. A percentage of this 1 RM is then
                      taken to determine a training weight. While lifting, the
                      concentric contraction (shortening of the muscle and
                      decrease in angle of a joint) should be performed in 1-2
                      seconds. The eccentric contraction (lengthening of the
                      muscle and increase in the angle of the joint) should last
                      4 seconds. For example, while performing a barbell biceps
                      curl, the weight is lifted up in 1-2 seconds and lowered
                      in 4 seconds.

                      Periodization is based on the theory that hard, high
                      intensity work over extended periods of time can lead to
                      burnout, injury and stagnation. Better progress can be
                      made following a periodization schedule. The periodization
                      cycle can be found in Appendix D for weight training and
                      in Appendix E for Focus-pads.

                      By following this scientifically based training program,
                      you can be assured of making optimal results. The main
                      objective is to be consistent with it. On days you feel
                      like skipping the workout, remind yourself of your goals.
                      Its better to decrease the intensity and do the workout
                      then to not do it at all. The #l reason for quitting an
                      exercise program was given in a survey: The participants
                      perceived the training as too hard. There is no better way
                      to discourage a new exerciser then to crush their
                      enthusiasm with a killer workout. There is no need to jump
                      into a new program head first. Take your time, set short
                      &amp; long term goals, and you will be on the path to
                      success.
